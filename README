The server requires Node.js version 0.4.5 or later.

To run the server, cd into the WebSocketTest2 directory and run 'node server.js'.

To connect to the server, load index.html in a compatible browser, type in your name and the ip address of the server in the form and click connect.

In Firefox you need to enable websocket support.
In Chrome, if you open index.html as a file, rather than retrieving it via HTTP, you will need to start your browser with the '--allow-file-access-from-files' flag.
